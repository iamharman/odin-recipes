    <title>The Perfect Margarita</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Mastering the margarita requires a certain amount of
        practice, but once you dial-in your perfect ratio, 
        it's a really easy cocktail to replicate. 
        The classic recipe is 3 parts tequila, 2 parts triple 
        sec, and 1 part freshly squeezed lime juice, and you 
        should probably start off pretty close to that, but 
        my personal favorite proportions are 4-3-2.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Lime wedge</li>
        <li>1 pinch coarse sea salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 Large Ice Cube</li>
        <li>Ice</li>
        <li>2 fluid ounces white tequila</li>
        <li>1 1/2 fluid ounces triple sec</li>
        <li>1 fluid ounces freshly squeezed lime juice</li>
        <li>1 slice Lime</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Moisten the rim of a glass with a lime wedge. 
            Sprinkle salt onto a plate. Lightly dip the 
            moistened rim into the salt. Place a large ice 
            cube in the glass and freeze the prepared glass 
            until ready to serve.</li>
        <li>Fill a cocktail shaker with fresh ice. 
            Add tequila, triple sec, and lime juice. 
            Cover and shake vigorously until outside of 
            the shaker has frosted. Strain into the 
            prepared glass and garnish with a slice of lime.
        </li>
    </ol>
